        <h3>Space, the final frontier</h3>
        <p>These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year 
          mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new 
          civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

        <h3>Many say ...</h3>
        <p>Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our 
          duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of 
          the human species.</p>

        <h3>To be the first to enter the cosmos</h3>
        <p>To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an
          unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything more? 
          There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both 
          figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. 
          And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill 
          of just beginning.</p>
